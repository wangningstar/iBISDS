When the angle of horizontal lifeline sag is less than 30 degrees, the impact force imparted to the lifeline by an attached lanyard is greatly amplified.

367,"(1) This appendix serves as a guideline to assist employers complying with the requirements of § 1926.501(b)(10). Section 1926.501(b)(10) allows the use of a safety monitoring system alone as a means of providing fall protection during the performance of roofing operations on lowsloped roofs 50 feet (15.25 m) or less in width. Each example in the appendix shows a roof plan or plans and indicates where each roof or roof area is to be measured to determine its width. Section views or elevation views are shown where appropriate. Some examples show ‘‘correct’’ and ‘‘incorrect’’ subdivisions of irregularly shaped roofs divided into smaller, regularly shaped areas. In all examples, the dimension selected to be the width of an area is the lesser of the two primary dimensions of the area, as viewed from above. Example A shows that on a simple rectangular roof, width is the lesser of the two primary overall dimensions. This is also the case with roofs which are sloped toward or away from the roof center, as shown in Example B.",50 feet (15.25 m),What is the minimum width of a lowsloped roof?,What is the maximum width for a roof that can be protected using a safety monitoring system under § 1926.501(b)(10)?
368,(2) Many roofs are not simple rectangles. Such roofs may be broken down into subareas as shown in Example C. The process of dividing a roof area can produce many different configurations. Example C gives the general rule of using dividing lines of minimum length to minimize the size and number of the areas which are potentially less than 50 feet (15.25 m) wide. The intent is to minimize the number of roof areas where safety monitoring systems alone are sufficient protection.,50 feet (15.25 m),What is the minimum width of a roof area?,What is the minimum length of a dividing line that should be used to minimize the size and number of roof areas potentially less than 50 feet (15.25 m) wide?
